# WIP: GFSC's Jekyll Boilerplate

There are many boilerplates out there, but this is ours.

## Site setup list

1. Register domain name [and configure to use GHP](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
1. Create Google Analytics account and place key in `config.yml`
1. Create favicons and touch icons using [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
1. Create OG images at 2:1 and 1:1 ratios. Make sure they're linked properly in `includes/meta.html`.
