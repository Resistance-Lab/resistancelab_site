Our work is an ongoing collaboration between activists, community groups, students, academics, and citizens. Our eventual goal is a world free of state violence with a special focus on Black and Brown communities where we are based in Manchester, UK.

By creating a space for the communities affected the most by state violence to work with researchers and technologists, we believe we can find new and better ways to work together to resist the increasingly data-driven architecture of state oppression. We believe this will create more just and equitable communities where everyone is included.

## What is state violence?

Write your definition here. Why do we use this term? Why do we not use another term? Basically if someone totally new comes here they won’t have the backstory about NPMP, KoC etc.

Need a collective understanding of the term. Find out who agrees/disagrees with us on this term. Be ready for it to change as we grow.

## About Resistance Lab

Resistance Lab in (as far as possible) a non-hierarchical group based in Manchester, UK. We are organised into several “Working Groups” with different specialities.

[Read more about the group](/about-us)

We welcome new members interested in joining our group. Police officers, people who work in the prisons or probation service, and serving military officers are not welcome. We do therefore have a short vetting process to keep the group a safe place for those who have been the victims of state violence.
