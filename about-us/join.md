New members are welcomed

But we do some vetting

Application/registration form

Membership is open to anyone with an interest in helping Resistance Lab pursue its aim of
confronting (racist) state violence locally, nationally and globally – providing that no member
has any concerns that an individual is associated with the police and/or another agency that
may compromise Resistance Lab’s independence from the state.
To join Resistance Lab, it is not necessary to have a university background, nor a tech
background. Our meetings are a great place to discuss and learn about new concepts, ideas
and debates.
Membership is available to anyone regardless of gender identity, race, nationally, disability,
sexual preference, religion or belief. Members from communities and/or backgrounds that are
traditionally over-policed and/or subjected to other forms of state violence are particularly
encouraged.

How do I get involved?

[clarify process for this] Assuming that no other member objects, you will be added to the
Resistance Lab email list and invited to attend all meetings. [what happens if someone
objects?]

If you want to leave the group at any time, please let one of the Co-Chairs know, so that they
can remove you from the email list. You do not have to provide a reason for wanting to leave.
And you’re welcome to re-join at any time.

Please let one of the Co-Chairs know if you are experiencing any harassment or unwanted
attention [anything else] by another Resistance Lab member and they will seek to resolve it.
If you do not attend a Resistance Lab meeting or use the email list for [X] months, a Co-
Chair may ask if you would still like to be a member of the group.
