New members are welcome

But we do some vetting

Application/registration form

Membership is open to anyone with an interest in helping Resistance Lab pursue its aim of
confronting (racist) state violence locally, nationally, and globally – providing that no member
has any concerns that an individual is associated with the police and/or another agency that
may compromise Resistance Lab’s independence from the state.
To join Resistance Lab, it is not necessary to have a university background, nor a tech
background. Our meetings are a great place to discuss and learn about new concepts, ideas
and debates.
Membership is available to anyone regardless of gender identity, race, nationality, disability,
sexual preference, religion or belief. Members from communities and/or backgrounds that are
traditionally over-policed and/or subjected to other forms of state violence are particularly
welcome.

How do I get involved?

Any prospective new member of Resistance Lab must be referred (or vouched for) by a current member. 
The current member must put forward the potential member’s name during a meeting or on the listserv. 
If there is no objection from any other current member, the new member will be added to the listserv. 
Assuming that no other member objects, you will be added to the Resistance Lab email list and 
invited to attend all meetings.

If you want to leave the group at any time, please let one of the Co-Chairs know, so that they
can remove you from the email list. You do not have to provide a reason for wanting to leave.
And you’re welcome to re-join at any time.

Please let one of the Co-Chairs know if you are experiencing a conflict with another Resistance Lab 
member, or if you have experienced any harassment or unwanted attention, and they will seek to resolve 
it.

If you do not attend a Resistance Lab meeting or use the email list for [X] months, a Co-
Chair may ask if you would still like to be a member of the group.
