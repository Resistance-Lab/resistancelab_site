1. We want Resistance Lab to be a safe space for all members.
1. Don't use language that 'punches down' other people.
1. If you mess up, you have the chance to do better. Apologise and move on.

Inclusive policies and guides are needed to facilitate a safe and supportive environment. We want Resistance Lab meetings to be safe for every person attending. To that end, every member of Resistance Lab is required to abide by this policy, including in the group chats and and at special events.

A core goal of the group is equity of sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance, ability, race, colour, religion, national origin, class, age, and profession. One of the ways oppressions are manifested is through language, so please do not engage in language which 'punches down', including but not limited to racism, transphobia, sexism, and fatphobia. We have no interest in 'devil's advocate' positions: 'It’s just a bit of fun', 'It’s just a joke', 'They’re my friend so it’s okay', 'I was drunk', 'I was being ironic', etc. are not excuses.

We all mess up sometimes. The world is a profoundly unequal place, and it’s impossible to not be affected by it. If you say something and are called out on it, then apologise and move on. Recognise that when someone calls you out, it's because they want you to do better; it isn't an attack on your character. If you disagree or don’t understand, that’s ok - but take a second and think of a way you can ask without being aggressive to the person who asked. It can be upsetting to be challenged on this stuff - we are here for you, but not if you’re a dick about it! We encourage all participants of Resistance Lab to start a dialogue with us if they are unsure of anything.

If you do say something wrong to someone, such as misgendering them, one of the best ways to handle that is immediately apologise, then let the conversation move on. If you are unfamiliar with people using they/them pronouns, you can find a guide at theythem.xyz. 

If someone has said or done something wrong to you, you may bring it up with them or, if you prefer, take this issue to the Leadership team. Repeated or unapologetic violations of the code of conduct are grounds for removal from Resistance Lab.
