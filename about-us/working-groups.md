## Management Group

This group helps plan events, write documents like this one, work up proposals into full documents that can be discussed by the whole group, and generally ensure the group is continuing to effectively achieve its aims. The management group may also take the decision to suspend or remove a member. Proposals for new working groups should be brought to this meeting to allow a full discussion before suggesting a proposal to the larger group. The management group is open to any group member willing to attend 2 meetings out of every 3.

## Data Group

This group is tasked with accessing, monitoring, analysing, and storing data on state violence.

## Communications Group

This group disseminates Resistance Lab’s activities and reports on social media, maintains the website, authors blog posts, identifies opportunities to share our work, and responds to media requests. This group is also responsible for developing and revising Resistance Lab’s general media strategy.


We form additional working groups to pursue projects related to specific campaigns or tasks.
