<!-- Introduction -->

{% include box.html colour="white" %}

We are an anti-racist group who seek to understand, expose, and educate others about how state violence affects marginalised communities. Resistance Lab members meet semi-regularly to organise around the local (Greater Manchester) dimensions of the global challenge presented by (racist) state violence.

Central to our work is the development of technological and/or creative outputs to raise public awareness about different forms of state violence.

We are committed to participatory, democratic approaches that bring tech and data experts into collaborative partnership with anti-racist activists, in order to find new ways to resist state violence and create more just and equitable communities.

Through workshops and meetings, we have worked together to analyse stop and search data in our community, partnered with local archives to uncover marginalised and suppressed narratives of people who have died following police custody, and helped families with the emotional and legal support necessary to investigate and challenge decisions.
