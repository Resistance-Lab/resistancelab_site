We work hard to make sure our work is accurate, high quality, and statistically sound.

## Methodology

As far as possible we use public data sources and references for all our work. All of the data we have used, information on sourcing, and some sample analyses are available in our [public data repository](http://data.resistancelab.network/).

We use [Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@resistancelab) where appropriate to create the graphs and charts for our reports. This is an interactive programming environment that allows for live manipulation of all graphs and calculations.

We encourage other groups to review, modify and adapt our methodology, and welcome collaborations on state violence datasets.

## Corrections and clarifications

Resistance Lab is committed to producing high quality reports based on accurate data and findings. If you see a mistake anywhere in our reports or on our website, please let us know by emailing [info@resistance.network](mailto:info@resistance.network).

We will correct any errors as quickly and transparently as possible and make a note of them on the affected pages.
