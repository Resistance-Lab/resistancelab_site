Police Taser usage in England and Wales is now at its highest-ever levels, according to new Home Office data for 2019-20.

In August 2020, Resistance Lab published _A Growing Threat to Life: Taser Usage by Greater Manchester Police_ (GMP), a report documenting the intrinsic and potentially lethal threat posed by Taser in the hands of police in England and Wales. We wrote the report in response to the stories of the many victims of police Taser usage here in Greater Manchester and around the country. Since their introduction in 2003, 18 people have died following Taser usage by police and many more have sustained serious injury and trauma. In many cases, these individuals and their families have fought protracted battles through complaints processes, independent investigations and the courts.

Despite multiple assurances to the contrary, Greater Manchester Police’s Taser use, like much of the country, is now the highest on record, with last year’s statistics showing an even more highly disproportionate impact on Black people and other vulnerable populations. Despite statements in support of Black Lives Matter from GMP, the institution of a new Race Equality panel, the imposition of ‘special measures’ on GMP, the resignation of the GMP’s their most senior officer over data mishandling, and Michael Gilchrist and his family finally getting justice after many years of dismissal from Manchester authorities, Greater Manchester Police have now announced they want to **double the number of Tasers on the street**.

We say no more.

**Join our public discussion on March 18th at 17:00 - 18:30 GMT.**

The event will be [livestreamed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvzXnxZlpDzJNSnJj8ej_mw), and available on our website afterwards.

### Panel

**Chair: Patrick Williams (he/him), MMU & Resistance Lab.** Patrick is a senior lecturer and activist. His interests are in the areas of 'race' and ethnicity, with a particular focus on racial disparity, disproportionality and differential treatment within the Criminal Justice System.

He authored _[Being Matrixed: the (over)policing of gang suspects in London](http://www.stop-watch.org/uploads/documents/Being_Matrixed.pdf)_ on behalf of Stopwatch, which foregrounds the narratives through storied recollections of young peoples' experiences of being registered and policed as a gang suspect. He also co-authored _Dangerous Associations: joint enterprise, gangs and racism_. This study explores the complex, yet misconstrued associations of black people who are (police) identified as involved with serious violence, demonstrating how the ‘gang’ label drives the imposition of harsh collective punishments and lengthy custodial sentences.
