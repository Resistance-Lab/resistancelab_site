At the end of July, we released our first report, [A Growing Threat to Life: Taser Usage by Greater Manchester Police](https://resistancelab.network/our-work/taser-report/index.html). The report highlights the significant increase in Taser usage by Greater Manchester Police (GMP), and the profound dangers posed by Taser usage. The report also shows that Taser usage disproportionately harms Black and Brown communities, children, and people with mental and physical disabilities.

The report featured on ITV Granada, Channel 4 News, [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/xg85x4/vast-increase-in-police-taser-use-a-threat-to-life-report-warns), [The Voice](https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/uk-news/2020/08/02/police-taser-use-poses-a-growing-threat-to-life-says-report/), [Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/calls-ban-tasers-use-rises-18682435), [The Meteor](https://www.themeteor.org/2020/08/01/police-taser-use-increase-poses-growing-threat-to-life-report-warns/), and others. We have been inundated with support from individuals and from community groups.

None of the report’s findings have been disputed by either Greater Manchester Police, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Baroness Beverly Hughes, or the Mayor’s office. However, those in power have completely ignored our core demand: **to abolish Taser immediately**.

Whilst we are not expecting change quickly or easily, Tasers pose an urgent threat that must be faced. We therefore want to ramp up the pressure and many have asked what they can do to support. Here are a few easy things that you can do:

1. [**Sign our new petition**](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/333260) to demand a discussion in parliament about the abolition of Taser [on UK Parliament's petition site](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/333260).
2. **Send a letter or email to your MP** or regional mayor demanding the abolition of Taser in your area. A stock letter is available below.
3. [**Make a donation**](https://www.memorialfamilyfund.org.uk/donations) to support the families and friends who have lost their lives to police violence via the [United Friends & Family Campaign](https://www.memorialfamilyfund.org.uk/).
4. **Continue to share** the report on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ResLabMcr) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ResLabMcr) and [get in touch](/contact) to let us know what you are doing locally.

**The pressure to abolish Taser is growing!**

### Our letter to Baroness Beverly Hughes

Dear Baroness Beverly Hughes,

We are writing to you in your capacity as Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime to express our deep concerns with Greater Manchester Police’s use of Conducted Energy Devices (Taser).

You may be aware that we, Resistance Lab, published a detailed report into GMP’s use of Taser at the end of July 2020, available at the link below. The report was featured on the national and regional news (Channel 4 and ITV) and covered by a range of online media sources. Using Home Office data, the report shows that in the last year alone, Greater Manchester Police’s use of Tasers increased by 73%. This rate of increase exceeded the national average of 39%, as well as that of comparable forces such as the Metropolitan Police which reported a 49% increase in the use of Tasers. It is clear that GMP are using Taser, whether discharged or not, more than any other police force, except for the Metropolitan police.

The report also highlights that GMP are using Taser against Black people at nearly 4 times the rate of their white counterparts. This should be of significant concern to you and to GMP, given the widespread public concerns about institutional racism spotlighted by the recent Black Lives Matter protests in the UK and globally. It is also worrying that GMP are using Tasers against children and vulnerable adults, particularly individuals with mental health issues. Indeed, GMP report more incidents involving children under the age of 18 than any other force with the exception of the Metropolitan Police. This points to violence and threats of violence becoming normalised against the most vulnerable in our communities.

Whilst we note the forthcoming publication of the Greater Manchester Race Equality Policing Report, it seems abundantly clear to us, and the affected communities that we work with, that more state-led enquiries and reports are not what is needed. The evidence of racially disproportionate and violent policing is plain to see. It is incisive action that we require from you now and we urge you to push for the limiting of police powers and reinvestment, instead, in our community infrastructures. If you are serious about addressing violence and improving community safety, we urge you to recognise the great harm caused by Taser usages, and to take seriously our report’s (evidence-based) recommendation for the abolition of Taser.

Sincerely,

Resistance Lab
